abstract="Providing vibrotactile feedback that corresponds to the state of the virtual texture surfaces allows users to sense haptic properties of them. However, hand-tuning such vibrotactile stimuli for every state of the texture takes much time. Therefore, we propose a new approach to create models that realize the automatic vibrotactile generation from texture images or attributes. In this paper, we make the first attempt to generate the vibrotactile stimuli leveraging the power of deep generative adversarial training. Specifically, we use conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) to achieve generation of vibration during moving a pen on the surface. The preliminary user study showed that users could not discriminate generated signals and genuine ones and users felt realism for generated signals. Thus our model could provide the appropriate vibration according to the texture images or the attributes of them. Our approach is applicable to any case where the users touch the various surfaces in a predefined way.",

abstract="This paper describes new applications of a locomotion interface that uses fingers instead of legs. With this device, users let two fingers ``stand'' or ``walk'' on a ball floating on water. The first-person perspective presented to the user is updated according to the state of the ball. The aim is to make users feel virtually present by means of the synchrony between their vision and the haptic information from their fingers. The difficulty of controlling of the ball with fingers lets users subjectively experience an unsteady foothold. The proposed system is structured to be space saving and cost effective compared to an ordinary full-body motion simulator and is thus suitable for museum exhibitions.",

We believe that the illusion in the contact area can be caused by the sense of ownership derived from the close relationship of the motion between the fingers and the avatar's legs. The objective of this study was to prove the possibility that fingers can be substituted in the place of legs in locomotion interfaces in terms of tactile sensation.",

We used the finite element method (FEM) and the penalty method for physics-based computations of forces and deformations on the contact area. To accelerate the computation, we developed an efficient method that utilizes the link structure of the hand. Using this model, users can perform object manipulation and get visual feedback from the deformations in the skin.",
