abstract = "This paper describes new applications of a locomotion interface that uses fingers instead of legs. With this device, users let two fingers ``stand'' or ``walk'' on a ball floating on water. The first-person perspective presented to the user is updated according to the state of the ball. The aim is to make users feel virtually present by means of the synchrony between their vision and the haptic information from their fingers. The difficulty of controlling of the ball with fingers lets users subjectively experience an unsteady foothold. The proposed system is structured to be space saving and cost effective compared to an ordinary full-body motion simulator and is thus suitable for museum exhibitions."
