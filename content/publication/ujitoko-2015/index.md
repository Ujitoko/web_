abstract = "The demonstration described in this paper attempts to give users tactile feedback on the sole of the virtual avatar using the locomotion interface of anthropomorphic finger motions. We believe that the illusion in the contact area can be caused by the sense of ownership derived from the close relationship of the motion between the fingers and the avatar's legs. The objective of this study was to prove the possibility that fingers can be substituted in the place of legs in locomotion interfaces in terms of tactile sensation."
