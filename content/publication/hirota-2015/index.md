abstract = "This study investigated the implementation of a deformable elastic hand model. We used the finite element method (FEM) and the penalty method for physics-based computations of forces and deformations on the contact area. To accelerate the computation, we developed an efficient method that utilizes the link structure of the hand. Using this model, users can perform object manipulation and get visual feedback from the deformations in the skin."
